# Minecraft 1.21 Integration Plan

This document tracks new content introduced with Minecraft/Spigot 1.21.x and how it could be leveraged in Slimefun.

## New Entities
- **Armadillo** – drops *armadillo scutes* used to craft **wolf armor**. Could be integrated as a renewable resource in mob farms.
- **Bogged** – a poison‑shooting skeleton variant. Loot can feed advanced bow recipes or toxic materials.
- **Breeze & Breeze Wind Charge** – ranged Trial Chamber mob. Wind Charges may power new kinetic machinery.
- **Creaking** – hostile wood variant added in 1.21.2. Potential ingredient for magical or spooky items.

## New Items & Blocks
- **Crafter** – programmable redstone crafting block. Might serve as a low‑tier automatic crafting machine or ingredient for existing Slimefun crafters.
- **Copper Bulb** – light‑emitting block controllable via redstone. Useful for decorative light sources or energy network indicators.
- **Tuff & Tuff Variants** – additional decorative stones. Can be processed in grinders for stone‑based resources.
- **Trial Spawner / Vault** – components of Trial Chambers. Vault keys could be hooked into new loot‑crate mechanics.
- **Wind Charge & Breeze Rod** – dropped from Breezes; potential ammunition or power source.
- **Ominous Bottle** – applies new status effects; could be used in magic‑related machines.
- **Wolf Armor** – protection for tamed wolves, crafted using Armadillo Scutes. Could be augmented in Slimefun with enchantments or upgrades.

## New Status Effects & Potions
Effects `OOZING`, `WEAVING`, `WIND_CHARGED`, and `INFESTED` are now available and can be produced using the corresponding potion types. Slimefun machines dealing with potion brewing should support these types.


## Next Steps
1. Implement Slimefun recipes for the new blocks and items.
2. Extend mob drop tables and machines to interact with the new entities.
3. Update documentation and in‑game guides once gameplay integration is finalized.

## Progress
- Added a recipe for **Wolf Armor** crafted from Armadillo Scutes in the Enhanced Crafting Table.
- Medical supplies now cleanse the new status effects: `OOZING`, `WEAVING`, `WIND_CHARGED`, and `INFESTED`.
- Auto-crafter machines now require the vanilla Crafter block in their recipes.
- Wolf Armor can be crafted in the Armor Forge using Armadillo Scutes.
1. **Done:** Added crafting support for Crafter, Copper Bulb and Wolf Armor.
2. Extend mob drop tables and machines to interact with the new entities.
3. Update documentation and in‑game guides once gameplay integration is finalized.
