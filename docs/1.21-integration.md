This document summarises the new content introduced with Minecraft/Spigot 1.21.x and how Slimefun integrates it.

## New Entities

## New Items & Blocks
- **Crafter** – programmable redstone crafting block required in auto-crafter recipes.
- **Copper Bulb** – light-emitting block controllable via redstone and craftable in the Enhanced Crafting Table.
- **Tuff & Tuff Variants** – additional decorative stones that can be processed in grinders for stone-based resources.
