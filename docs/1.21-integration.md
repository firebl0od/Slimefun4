# Minecraft 1.21 Integration Plan

This document tracks new content introduced with Minecraft/Spigot 1.21.x and how it could be leveraged in Slimefun.

## New Entities
- **Armadillo** – drops *armadillo scutes* used to craft **wolf armor**. Could be integrated as a renewable resource in mob farms.
- **Bogged** – a poison-shooting skeleton variant. Loot can feed advanced bow recipes or toxic materials.
- **Breeze & Breeze Wind Charge** – ranged Trial Chamber mob. Wind Charges may power new kinetic machinery.
- **Creaking** – hostile wood variant added in 1.21.2. Potential ingredient for magical or spooky items.

## New Items & Blocks
- **Crafter** – programmable redstone crafting block. Might serve as a low-tier automatic crafting machine or ingredient for existing Slimefun crafters.
- **Copper Bulb** – light-emitting block controllable via redstone. Useful for decorative light sources or energy network indicators.
- **Tuff & Tuff Variants** – additional decorative stones. Can be processed in grinders for stone-based resources.
- **Trial Spawner / Vault** – components of Trial Chambers. Vault keys could be hooked into new loot-crate mechanics.
- **Wind Charge & Breeze Rod** – dropped from Breezes; potential ammunition or power source.
- **Ominous Bottle** – applies new status effects; could be used in magic-related machines.
- **Heavy Core & Mace** – heavy weapon components from Trial Chambers. The Mace is forged from a Heavy Core and Breeze Rod.
- **Wolf Armor** – protection for tamed wolves, crafted using Armadillo Scutes. Could be augmented in Slimefun with enchantments or upgrades.

## New Status Effects & Potions
Effects `OOZING`, `WEAVING`, `WIND_CHARGED`, and `INFESTED` are now available and can be produced using the corresponding potion types. The Auto-Brewer accepts **Slime Blocks**, **Cobwebs**, **Breeze Rods**, and **Stone** to craft these potions automatically. Slimefun machines dealing with potion brewing should support these types.

## Current Integration
- Auto-crafter machines now require the vanilla Crafter block in their recipes.
- Wolf Armor can be crafted in the Armor Forge using Armadillo Scutes.
- Tuff and its variants can be crushed into sand by the Ore Crusher and Electric Ore Grinder.
- Auto-Brewer can brew Oozing, Weaving, Wind Charging and Infestation potions.
- Produce Collector can brush Armadillos for Armadillo Scutes.
- Butcher Android harvests Breeze Rods, Wind Charges, mushrooms from Bogged, and Creaking Hearts.
- Wind Charges, Armadillo Scutes and Creaking Hearts appear as vanilla items in the Slimefun guide.
- Medical Supplies cure Oozing, Weaving, Wind Charged and Infested effects.
- Copper Bulb can be crafted in the Enhanced Crafting Table.
- Ominous Bottle can be crafted in the Magic Workbench.
- Trial Key can be crafted in the Magic Workbench.
- Vault and Trial Spawner can be crafted in the Enhanced Crafting Table.
- Heavy Core can be crafted in the Enhanced Crafting Table.
- Mace can be crafted in the Enhanced Crafting Table using a Heavy Core and Breeze Rod.

## Next Steps
1. Finalize mob drop tables and machine interactions for any remaining 1.21 entities.
2. Update documentation and in-game guides once gameplay integration is finalized.
